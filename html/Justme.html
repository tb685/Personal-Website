<p>Art has been a part of my life since a very young age. It seemed like everyone I've ever met were set for
successful careers,<br>while I was only good at...creating things. In my free time I started practicing guitar,
learning digital art, writing, and recently<br>I picked up 3d modeling. On top of that I am learning
professional photography and building my photo/video editing skills.<br>And these are just a few main
things. However, it is more like a hobby to collect creative skills, rather than a suitable job resume.
